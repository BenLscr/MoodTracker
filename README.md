# MoodTracker
This app is a school project for OpenClassrooms.

Moodtracker is an Android mobile app. Every day, the user notes his mood in the application. If he wishes, he can add a comment to explain why he was happy ("I found a new job") or why he was unhappy ("There was no more cheesecake for dessert"). The history of his moods is also preserved, on a seven-day beach, allowing him at a glance to see his general mood. Each comment left can also be viewed.
